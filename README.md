# My configuration files

**NOTE:** The install scripts are meant for OSX 🍎. I'll add Linux 🐧 in the future, but feel free to contribute though.

The install scripts will install the following tools:

* ohmyzsh
* Slate
* Nvim
* Brew

### How to install

1 - Clone this repo into your `home` folder and run:

`bash ~/.config/install/install_all.sh`

2 - Be happy :)
